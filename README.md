   - If Java is not installed, download and install it from [Java's official website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

2. **Navigate to the Directory**
   - Open a terminal (Linux/macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows).
   - Change to the directory where `LIBRARY_SYSTEM.jar` is located. For example:
     ```sh
     cd path/to/LIBRARY_SYSTEM
     ```

3. **Run the JAR File**
   - Execute the JAR file with the following command:
     ```sh
